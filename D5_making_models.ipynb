    "We want to build different models to predict how much a professional soccer is worth when they move from team to team.  In case you were unaware, teams purchase players from each other for vast sums of money at the top levels of the game.  This money is completely different from the player's wages, which can also be huge numbers.  When club B purchases a player from club A, they have to agree with the selling club the value of the player, and seperately negotiate with the player what their new salary will be.  Both selling club and player have to agree before a transfer actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll investigate how to predict player value using data from the video game FIFA 2020 that we've previously used. The data is collected from a soccer video game where real pro players are encoded into the video game with stats that are supposed to accurately reflect the players in the real world.\n"

    "When building a linear model, we are usually trying to predict a numerical value (like `value_eur`) using other numerical values.  That's the form you're used to.  For example $ y = f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2  $. But note there can also be linear models that use a categorical inputs, such as $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 (\\textrm{nationality==England}) + \\beta_3 (\\textrm{nationality==Germany})$ that uses one numeric variable and one categorical variable to predict.  In this particular example the categorical nationality has only three possible values, England, Germany, and France with France being the default category.  When either of the Boolean arguments about nationality evaluate as True, then the associated beta is added to the existing intercept $\\beta_0$ which ends up representing French players as the default.  Thus you can see the English and German betas as representing the mean difference between those nationalities values and the French players.  \n",

    "Looking at the distribution of `value_eur`, we see that the histogram is right skewed, meaning that a significant amount of players have a lower monetary value, and only a few players have values that are several orders of magnitude more expensive.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite common whenever we look at data related to economics.  Inequality is part of most economic systems.  There are players in this dataset who are worth 10,000x as much as other players. Just like there are companies worth 10,000x as much as other companies and people with yearly incomes that are 10,000x times yours.  People and companies and players on the lower end of the income distribution will be common, and those on the upper end of the distribution will be only a percent or two of the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to keep in mind for future analysis, this distribution (like many economic measures) is not normally distributed. To use this column in our analyses, we need to apply a log transformation for `value_eur`. A good tip to keep in mind is that if the distribution of the data looks heavily right skewed or exponential, performing a log transformation can make the distribution resemble normal. We will do that transformation in a little bit\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two ways to do this: (1) seaborn has a specific function that visualizes counts.  Or (2) you can build it yourself using pandas native tools: start with the dataframe's method `.value_counts()` and then make a bar graph from that."

Players past 30 or so are starting to slow down and are unable to use their athletic abilities in the same way they could before.  So 25ish is the beginning of a player's peak ability, and it lasts until 30 or so.  When a player is closer to 25 the buying club gets more years of \"peak\" then they do when a player is closer to 30. Thus the peak of their valuation is close to 25/26.\n",

    "There are some causes for concern in these results (even if you did it perfectly).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. R-squared this high is very fishy.  I suspect we have overfit.  If we used this model to predict values in other years of the FIFA game I suspect it won't look as good as it does here.\n",
    "2. Note that the Prob(Omnibus) and Prob(JB) are two tests for the normality of residuals.  And they are telling us these residuals are wonky shaped.\n",
    "3. Kurtosis is huge, it should be around 3, and this indicates very heavy tails with some extreme outliers.\n",
    "4. Skew is huge (should be magnitude less than 1) and negative.  Which tells us that the left tail is heavier than the right.  So there's lots of lower value players that are being poorly predicted by this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did we do all this for nothing?  Hell no.  While we don't love this, OLS is probably still giving you some information about the real relationships here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally you would probably repeat this analysis using another method (like robust regresssion) that cares less about non-normal residuals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bare minimum when you write your project report you'd mention that the regressions may not be super believable given the problems highlighted here.  A caveat added to your discussion of results.  Not a killer, just a downer."
